## Hypermile

Hypermile is a Java Android mobile app that provides vehicle economy metrics. It requires the use of an ELM327 Bluetooth OBD-II scanner to retrieve real-time data from the vehicle ECU.

This was a final year university project which I received a high 1st and was my first time developing a mobile app.

To be able to develop this app away from a vehicle required the use of the <a href="https://github.com/Ms1Dev/ECU_Sim">ECU Simulator</a>, another creation of mine. Even when developing mobile apps I can't help but get microcontrollers involved somehow ;p
